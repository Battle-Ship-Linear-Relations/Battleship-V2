# Battleship-V2



Possible Ideas:
- add a method to add inequalities
- add a help button to know what the different difficulties are
- Add an instructions screen before the game begins
- Make both boards visible (the user's and computer's)
- Make an area that keeps track of everything inputted



Known Bugs:
- the bot may be able to input slopes that never occur within the range of the game board
